# Case Study Practice 2 
This project serves as the first hand-on practice on my Business Intelligence (BI) analytics skills. It is based on a given fictional topic and with some guidances from the course I am taking. BigQuery, SQL and Tableau will be used in the ETL process and data visualisation. It aims to show all the procedure and thought process here.

### Introduction
Imagine I am a business analyst in Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in New York City. The growth team wants to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.
